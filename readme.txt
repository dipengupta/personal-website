Okay, 

So, this is a long-weekend code jam that I am doing, Jul1-4, 2022 to finish off something that I should have done quite a while ago: a personal website.
The idea is pretty simple, it's like a portfolio website which I can link to when I apply for jobs.

It's a rather straightforward site with the following pages:
    -> Home
    -> Professional
    -> Academic
    -> Music
    -> Contact

Each mostly has the same layout, and is just serving up data.

========================================================================================================================

Things that will need to be updated (probably like once a year)
    -> new job deets
    -> new project deets
    -> new guitar deets

Open issues:
    -> need to get the buttons out of the carousel on big screens 

Future Enhancements:
    -> maybe add more pictures?


========================================================================================================================

NOTE: This is the base website, ought to work perfectly on local.
